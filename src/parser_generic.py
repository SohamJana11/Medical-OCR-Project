# The provided code defines an abstract base class MedicalDocParser using Python's abc module, which is used for Abstract Base Classes (ABCs). 
# This class has an abstract method parse() that needs to be implemented by subclasses.

#line 3 - This line imports the abc module in Python, which stands for Abstract Base Classes. 
#         The abc module provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes in Python.
#line 5 - This line defines a new class named MedicalDocParser. 
#         The metaclass=abc.ABCMeta argument specifies that this class is an abstract base class (ABC). 
#         An ABC is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but it defines methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.   
#line 6 - This line defines the constructor method __init__ for the MedicalDocParser class, which takes one argument text. 
#         The constructor initializes an instance of MedicalDocParser with the provided text.
#line 7 - Within the constructor, this line assigns the value of the text argument to the text attribute of the MedicalDocParser instance. 
#         This allows the text attribute to be accessed and used by methods within the class.
#line 9 - The @abc.abstractmethod decorator marks this method as abstract, indicating that it must be implemented by subclasses of MedicalDocParser.
#line 10 - This line defines an abstract method named parse within the MedicalDocParser class. 
    
    
#Abstract methods are methods that are declared in a base class but are meant to be implemented by subclasses. 
#In this case, parse is an abstract method that should be implemented to define specific parsing behavior for different types of medical documents.
#The use of abstract methods ensures that subclasses adhere to a consistent interface while allowing flexibility in implementation details.
    

#In Python, ABCMeta stands for Abstract Base Class Meta, and it's a metaclass used to create abstract base classes (ABCs).
# 1. Meta:   In Python, a metaclass is a class of a class. 
#         That is, while a class defines the behavior of instances (objects), a metaclass defines the behavior of classes. 
#         Metaclasses are responsible for creating classes dynamically.
# 2. Abstract Base Class (ABC):     An abstract base class is a Python class that cannot be instantiated directly. 
#                               It's used to define a blueprint for other classes, ensuring that certain methods are implemented by its subclasses.
# 3. ABCMeta:     It's a specific metaclass provided by the abc module in Python. 
#                 When a class is defined with metaclass=abc.ABCMeta, it becomes an abstract base class. 
#                 This means that any class inheriting from it must implement all abstract methods defined within it, or it will raise an error at runtime.
